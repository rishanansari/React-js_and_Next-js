Building UI with Components

Three core concept of react:
Components
Props
State

**Components**
User interfaces can be broken down into smaller building blocks called components.

In React, components are functions. Inside your script tag, create a new function called header.

A component is a function that returns UI elements.

To render this component to the DOM, pass it as the first argument in the ReactDOM.render() method:

<script type="text/jsx">
  const app = document.getElementById("app")
 
 
  function Header() {
    return (<h1>Develop. Preview. Ship.</h1>)
  }
 
  ReactDOM.render(<Header/>, app)
</script>

Notes:
React components should be capitalized to distinguish them from plain HTML and JavaScript.
React components the same way you'd use regular HTML tags, with angle brackets <>.

**Nesting components**
homepage -> header

function Header() {
  return <h1>Develop. Preview. Ship.</h1>;
}
 
function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
    </div>
  );
}
 
ReactDOM.render(<HomePage />, app);
