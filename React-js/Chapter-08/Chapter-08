From React to Next.js

So far, we explored how you can get started with React. This is what the final code looked like. If you're starting from here, paste this code into an index.html file in your code editor.

<html>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
 
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@17/umd/react.development.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>
 
    <script type="text/jsx">
      const app = document.getElementById("app")
 
      function Header({ title }) {
        return <h1>{title ? title : "Default title"}</h1>
      }
 
      function HomePage() {
        const names = ["Ada Lovelace", "Grace Hopper", "Margaret Hamilton"]
 
        const [likes, setLikes] = React.useState(0)
 
        function handleClick() {
          setLikes(likes + 1)
        }
 
        return (
          <div>
            <Header title="Develop. Preview. Ship." />
            <ul>
              {names.map((name) => (
                <li key={name}>{name}</li>
              ))}
            </ul>
 
            <button onClick={handleClick}>Like ({likes})</button>
          </div>
        )
      }
 
      ReactDOM.render(<HomePage />, app)
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

While React excels at building UI, it does take some work to independently build that UI into a fully functioning scalable application. There are also newer React features, like Server and Client Components, that require a framework. The good news is that Next.js handles much of the setup and configuration and has additional features to help you build React applications.

Next, we'll migrate the example from React to Next.js, discuss how Next.js works, and introduce you to the differences between Server and Client Components.
