Rendering User Interfaces (UI)
What is the DOM?
The DOM is an object representation of the HTML elements. It acts as a bridge between your code and the user interface, and has a tree-like structure with parent and child relationships.

You can use DOM methods and JavaScript, to listen to user events and manipulate the DOM by selecting, adding, updating, and deleting specific elements in the user interface. DOM manipulation allows you to not only target specific elements, but also change their style and content.
