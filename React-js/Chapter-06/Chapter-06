Displaying Data with Props

What if you want to use you components multiple time and need to add different data for each of the Same Component.

We can pass ddwn the data from parents to child components.

**USING PROPS**
child component, can accept those props as its first function parameter.

continue to the sam example.
passing the attribute like HTML or Argument as function to the component

<Hedear title="React">

child component, can accept those props as its first function parameter.
function Header(props) {
  return <h1>Develop. Preview. Ship.</h1>;
}

if you console.log(props) -> get object with property -> { title: "React" }

Since props is an object, you can use object destructuring to explicitly name the values of props inside your function parameters

function Header({ title }) {
  console.log(title); // "React"
  return <h1>Develop. Preview. Ship.</h1>;
}

You can replace the H1 content to the proprs.

but wait it is a javascript writing inside the JSX so add curly braces {}.
These are a special JSX syntax that allows you to write regular JavaScript directly inside your JSX markup.

function Header({ title }) {
  console.log(title);
  return <h1>{title}</h1>;
}

we can add any javascript expression inside these curly braces {}.
