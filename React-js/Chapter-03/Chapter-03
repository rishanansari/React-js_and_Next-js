In Basic html if we naeed to add on element or anything with the help of javascript so,
We have several method to implement javascript into the HTMl boiler plate (DOM methods)


Exapmle index.html

1. To get the element with the help og id, class or tagname
2. Create a new element 
3. Add a text node 
4. Append the childs one into another

**HTML vs DOM**

This is because the HTML represents the initial page content, whereas the DOM represents the updated page content which was changed by the JavaScript code you wrote.

**Imperative vs Declarative**
imperative programming is like giving a chef step-by-step instructions on how to make a pizza. Declarative programming is like ordering a pizza without being concerned about the steps it takes to make the pizza. üçï
