Getting Started with React

We need 2 React script to load React (unpkg.com)

1. React
2. React-Dom
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@17/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

Now in previous chapter-03 we have multiple lines script to add one element.

now remove all and add 1 ReactDom.render() method

 <script type="text/jsx">
      const app = document.getElementById('app');
      ReactDOM.render(<h1>Develop. Preview. Ship.</h1>, app);
</script>

Syntax - errot -> add bable to understand the JSX
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>

What is JSX: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to describe your UI in a familiar HTML-like syntax.
